                    Embedded system education is an enormous challenge for the universities because embedded system is at the intersection of different disciplines and in continuous rapid progress. Outstanding curriculum design of embedded system will keep students close to the requirements from industry. Embed club is planned and management by the students themselves. It helps the students to study embedded system consciously and actively.

                        EMBED CLUB is organized and managed by students who are interesting in embedded technology including undergraduates and graduates. EMBED CLUB will help students to study embedded system from the activities of EMBED CLUB. Then they can master knowledge of embedded system further and meet the requirements from research and industry. EMBED CLUB aims at the following goals:
                    <ul class="ulParagraph">
                        <li><strong>Sharing experiences <br></strong>
                            Sharing experiences among students plays an important in embedded system education. Students can exchange their experiences in EMBED CLUB. EMBED CLUB provides the basic platform for the exchange. Students will form their embedded technology community. In such community, they can publish their problems when they learn embedded system and get the help from the community. They can discuss and help each other in this community. During the discussion and assistance, they will understand embedded system more deeply. This is beneficial to them.
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Having more practice <br></strong>
                            We have designed many types of practice out of class. Most of such practice is provided through EMBED CLUB. Students will be divided into different teams according to the types of practice with the help from experienced students, sometimes from the teachers. Each team will complete their tasks after college hours. And some excellent students can apply to participate in our research groups after some practice in EMBED CLUB. All of above is helpful for their learning.

                        </li>

                        <li> <strong>Receiving new information <br></strong>
                            Embedded system has close relationship with industry. When there are huge changes in industry, they will impact on embedded system education quickly. And different universities have their own strong suits. The new information including embedded system update and progress in research should also be taught to students. Teachers cannot depict the new information in detail in limited hours in class. They can only provide a framework to students. Fortunately, EMBED CLUB can be taken as supplement to the teaching in class. Invited professors, specialists and senior engineers will give lectures to students. Additionally, some training will also be provided in EMBED CLUB. These lectures and trainings will help students to learn embedded system.


                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Activities <br></strong>
                            Practice is very important in embedded system education. The practice in class is limited according to the restricted credit hours of embedded system curriculum. Though students will learn the basic theory and practice skills through the study in class, they also need more changes to master knowledge of embedded system further. Several different types of activity have been developed and many activities have been held in EMBED CLUB. Students in EMBED CLUB have in sustaining progress in embedded system through these activities. Six types of activities have been emerged in EMBED CLUB to meet the requirements from industry and education. They are discussion, training, lecture, project, contest and research.
